# odmlib examples

## Introduction
The odmlib examples are small applications that demonstrate the use of the odmlib Python package for creating
and process ODM files, including extensions like Define-XML. The examples are intended to make it easier
to get started using the odmlib package.

The odmlib package simplifies working with the CDISC ODM data exchange standard and its extensions, such as 
Define-XML, in Python. The odmlib package provides an object-oriented interface to working with ODM documents
that simplifies creating and processing them. 

## Why odmlib?
The odmlib package satisfies my personal interest in working with ODM using an object-oriented 
interface in Python.

## Getting Started
See the [odmlib repository](https://github.com/swhume/odmlib) to get the odmlib pacakge. Eventually, it may 
make its way into PyPi, but for now you'll need to install from the source. The odmlib README provides 
instructions for getting started.

## Note
Effort will be made to update the odmlib_examples as odmlib and it's associated models are updated. If 
an example doesn't run correctly, please update to the latest version of odmlib.

## Limitations
The odmlib examples are simple programs intended to demonstrate some of the basic capabilities of odmlib.
The examples are not complete, production ready applications.

The odmlib package is still in development. Although is being actively used on several projects, additional 
use and testing may trigger updates or bug fixes. Create an issue in GitHub if you need some help getting
an example to run. Thanks for your patience.
